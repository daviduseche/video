project lets user select a file and uses file signature which is data used to verify the contents of file. It can refer to magic numbers which are bytes within a file used to identify the format of the file; generally a short sequence of bytes (most are 2-4 bytes long) placed at the beginning of the file.

the project uses react, redux, and semantic ui. The user can select a file, once selected the file name will show and when they choose check type, if the file mime type is one of the particular video type it will show which type if not it will show not found. I used react and redux to manage state, and used semantic ui to make the UI look a bit nicer and have it be a bit responsive at different viewports.


I created project using create-react-app, so to run just clone repo, install npm modules, and use npm start.  Thank you.
